## 🪙 Marketplace Storefront Integration

### Understanding the Unified Marketplace Model

The CDI Marketplace is **one unified store** where all merchants sell together, but each merchant has their own:
- **Merchant Coin** (unique to their business)
- **Storefront Profile** (their branded section)
- **Product Catalog** (their offerings)

**Key Concept**: Merchant coins serve as both **currency** AND **navigation/discovery tool** to find that seller's products.
