# External Contractor Affiliate Program (Software-Agnostic)

## 🎯 Core Concept

**"Got a lead you don't want? Send it to us in 30 seconds, earn 10-15% when we complete it."**

External contractors (like Nick with 20 years experience) don't need to join our platform as members. They stay in their own business, using whatever software they already use (HouseCall Pro, Jobber, ServiceTitan, Excel, etc.), and simply **forward unwanted leads** to earn passive income.

---

## 🧠 Why This Model Works

### 1. **No Integration Headaches**
- ❌ Don't need API access to HouseCall Pro
- ❌ Don't need webhook partnerships with Jobber
- ❌ Don't need ServiceTitan enterprise contracts
- ✅ External contractor manually forwards leads = **they ARE the integration**

### 2. **Works With ANY System**
The external contractor could be using:
- Professional software (HouseCall Pro, Jobber, ServiceTitan, Buildertrend)
- Basic tools (Excel, Google Calendar, QuickBooks)
- Old-school methods (Paper notebook, voicemail transcription)
- **Doesn't matter** - if they have a lead they don't want, they can send it to us

### 3. **Project Managers Handle Everything**
- External contractor submits lead → done
- **Our project manager** calls the client, qualifies the lead, explains the process
- Client never knows the lead came from another contractor (unless we want to disclose)
- External contractor stays completely hands-off, just collects checks

### 4. **Removes Liability from External Contractor**
Traditional referral scenario:
- Nick refers client to another contractor
- Job goes bad
- Client blames Nick: *"You recommended them!"*

Our model:
- Nick sends lead to Constructive Designs (the organization)
- **We** assign it to a member through competition system
- If job goes bad, client blames us, not Nick
- Nick's reputation stays protected

## 💰 Subscription Tiers (Revenue Model)

| Tier | Price | Commission | Max Leads/Month | Features |
|------|-------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Overflow Partner** | $29/mo | 10% | 10 leads | Mobile form access, basic dashboard |
| **Lead Salvage Pro** | $49/mo | 12% | 25 leads | Priority support, analytics dashboard |
| **Premium Partner** | $99/mo | 15% | Unlimited | Custom-branded form link, highest commission |

### Example Revenue Math (100 External Contractors)

**Scenario 1: Overflow Partner (Most Common)**
- 80 contractors × $29/mo = **$2,320/mo**
- They send 5 leads/month each = 400 leads
- 50% convert to completed jobs = 200 jobs
- Avg job value: $3,500
- Commission paid: 200 × $3,500 × 10% = **$70,000**
- Platform fee (10% from winning member): 200 × $3,500 × 10% = **$70,000**

**Scenario 2: Lead Salvage Pro**
- 15 contractors × $49/mo = **$735/mo**
- They send 15 leads/month each = 225 leads
- 60% convert (higher quality) = 135 jobs
- Commission paid: 135 × $3,500 × 12% = **$56,700**
- Platform fee: 135 × $3,500 × 10% = **$47,250**

**Scenario 3: Premium Partner**
- 5 contractors × $99/mo = **$495/mo**
- They send 30 leads/month each = 150 leads
- 70% convert (best quality) = 105 jobs
- Commission paid: 105 × $3,500 × 15% = **$55,125**
- Platform fee: 105 × $3,500 × 10% = **$36,750**

**Total Monthly Revenue:**
- Subscription fees: $2,320 + $735 + $495 = **$3,550/mo**
- Platform fees: $70,000 + $47,250 + $36,750 = **$154,000/mo**
- **Total: $157,550/mo** (minus commissions paid)
- **Net after commissions: $157,550 - $181,825 = -$24,275** ❌

Wait, that's wrong math. Let me recalculate:

### Corrected Revenue Math

**Total Jobs Completed:** 200 + 135 + 105 = **440 jobs/month**

**Revenue from Platform:**
- Subscription fees: $3,550/mo
- Platform fees (10% of gross): 440 × $3,500 × 10% = **$154,000/mo**
- **Total Revenue: $157,550/mo**

**Costs (Commissions Paid):**
- Overflow: 200 jobs × $3,500 × 10% = $70,000
- Lead Salvage: 135 jobs × $3,500 × 12% = $56,700
- Premium: 105 jobs × $3,500 × 15% = $55,125
- **Total Commissions: $181,825/mo**

**This is still negative!** The platform fee needs to be higher than the commission paid, OR we adjust the model:

### Option A: Platform Takes 20% (10% to platform, 10-15% to external contractor)
This means the winning member pays 20-25% total fees, which is steep but acceptable for:
- No marketing costs
- Pre-qualified leads
- Competition system (they chose to bid)

### Option B: External Contractor Commission Comes FROM Platform Fee
Platform takes 10% of gross job value:
- Overflow Partner gets 5% (platform keeps 5%)
- Lead Salvage Pro gets 6% (platform keeps 4%)
- Premium Partner gets 7.5% (platform keeps 2.5%)

This way subscription fees are pure profit, and we're just splitting our platform fee with the referrer.

**Let's go with Option B** - it's cleaner and easier to explain.

### Final Revenue Model (Revised)

**Platform Fee: 10% of completed job value (standard)**

**Commission Split:**
- Overflow Partner: Gets 5% (platform keeps 5%)
- Lead Salvage Pro: Gets 6% (platform keeps 4%)
- Premium Partner: Gets 7.5% (platform keeps 2.5%)

**New Math:**
- Subscription fees: **$3,550/mo** (pure profit)
- Platform keeps: $77,000 + $61,800 + $39,375 = **$178,175/mo**
- Commissions paid: $70,000 + $56,700 + $55,125 = **$181,825/mo**

Still slightly negative on the commission side, but **subscription fees cover the gap**:
- Net: $178,175 - $181,825 + $3,550 = **$100/mo** (barely profitable)

**OR** just keep it simple: External contractor gets 10%, platform keeps nothing extra. The value is:
1. **Subscription revenue** ($3,550/mo pure profit)
2. **Lead volume** (440 extra jobs/month for members = platform growth)
3. **Member fees** (winning members still pay 10% platform fee on jobs they win)

**Wait, I'm confusing myself.** Let me clarify the fee structure:

---

## 🧾 Fee Structure (FINAL)

### When a Lead Converts to Completed Job:

**Scenario: $3,500 roofing job**

1. **Client pays:** $3,500 (full amount)
2. **Winning member receives:** $3,500 (gross payment)
3. **Platform fee charged to member:** 10% = $350
4. **External contractor commission:** 10-15% of gross = $350-$525
5. **Platform net revenue:** $350 (platform fee) - $0 (we don't double-charge)

**Key Insight:** The external contractor commission is SEPARATE from platform fee.

So total fees on the job:
- Member pays: 10% platform fee = $350
- External contractor gets: 10-15% of gross = $350-$525 (paid by platform from subscription buffer)
- **Platform subsidizes the commission** using subscription revenue

This means:
- Subscription fees ($3,550/mo) subsidize commissions
- Platform fee ($154,000/mo) is normal platform revenue
- **Net: $154,000 + $3,550 - $181,825 = -$24,275/mo** ❌

**Hmm, still doesn't work. Let me rethink this...**

### ACTUAL Fee Structure (Final for Real)

**Option: Commission is Deducted from Platform Fee**

Platform fee: 10% of gross job value
Commission to external contractor: 5-7.5% of gross job value
Platform keeps: 2.5-5% of gross job value

**Example: $3,500 job**
- Client pays: $3,500
- Member receives: $3,150 (after 10% platform fee)
- Platform collects: $350
  - External contractor commission: $175-262.50
  - Platform keeps: $87.50-$175

**New Math with 440 jobs/month:**
- Subscription revenue: **$3,550/mo**
- Platform keeps: 440 × $175 (avg) = **$77,000/mo**
- **Total: $80,550/mo** ✅

This is much more sustainable!

## 🎮 The "Recycle Bin" Concept
