## 📱 **INITIAL TEXT MESSAGE:**

```
Hey [Name]! 

It's [Your Name] - I did that landscaping job for you a while back at [location/time if you remember].

I'm reaching out because I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit helping construction workers, and I have a business idea that could bring you 10-20+ new customers per month with ZERO cost to you.

I made a quick 3-minute video explaining the concept:

No pressure - watch when you have time! If it sounds interesting, just text/email me back and we can grab coffee.

Either way, hope business is going well! 🙏

## 🎥 **VIDEO SCRIPT (2-3 Minutes):**

### **[0:00-0:15] Opening Hook**
```
Hi [Name]! It's [Your Name] - thanks for taking time to watch this.

I'm running a nonprofit helping construction workers, and I want to 
pitch you a partnership that could bring you 10-20 new Cricket customers 
per month - completely free to you.

Here's how it works...
```

### **[0:15-0:45] The Problem We're Solving**
```
[Show old locked phone on screen]

Right now, we're collecting donated phones through our nonprofit.
Some are stolen (which we help return to owners), but MOST are just 
locked phones where someone:
  - Broke their contract early
  - Switched carriers before paying off
  - Had a family plan that got canceled

These phones are sitting in drawers, completely worthless... 
until now.

[Show pile of locked phones]
```

### **[0:45-1:30] The Opportunity for Cricket**
```
[Show Cricket logo]

Here's where YOU come in:

We have 100+ contractors on our platform who need phones for their crews.

What if we:
1. Bring you these locked phones (AT&T, T-Mobile compatible)
2. You help unlock them for activation on Cricket
3. We send contractors to YOUR store for service activation
4. They sign up for no-contract plans (4 for $100, etc.)
5. You get guaranteed new customers every single month

[Show simple diagram: Donated phones → Cricket unlocks → Contractors activate → Recurring revenue]

The best part? 
The phones stay locked to the AT&T/T-Mobile network anyway,
so even on a no-contract plan, they'll stay with Cricket for 
the remainder of the original financing period!

That's 6-12 months of GUARANTEED service revenue per phone!
```

### **[1:30-2:00] The Sweepstakes Angle**
```
[Show sweepstakes flyer mockup]

We also run monthly sweepstakes for people who donate phones.

OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU:
If you donate just ONE new phone + 1-year service plan as the 
grand prize, we'll:
  - Market YOUR store in all our communications
  - Drive 50-100+ people to enter the sweepstakes
  - Send them ALL to your store for phone donations/verification
  - Feature you as our "Official Phone Partner"

Cost to you: ~$400 wholesale (phone + service)
Value you get: 20-30+ new customer activations = $2,000-3,000 revenue

That's a 5-7X return on investment! 🚀
```

### **[2:00-2:30] What We Need from You**
```
[Show checklist]

Super simple:

✅ Help unlock donated phones when possible (takes 2 minutes)
✅ Offer standard no-contract family plans to our contractors
✅ Optional: Donate 1 phone + service per month for sweepstakes prize

That's it! No contracts, no commitments, no upfront costs.
```

### **[2:30-2:45] The Ask**
```
[Your face on camera]

[Name], I know you're busy running your store, so here's what I propose:

If this sounds interesting, text or email me back and let's grab 
coffee for 15 minutes. I'll show you exactly how it works.

I actually have MY OWN locked Metro phone right now that I want 
to test this with - we could literally do the first unlock together 
and see how easy it is.

No pressure either way - I just thought of you because I know you 
care about your community and I trust you from working together before.

Thanks for watching!
```

## 🎬 **VIDEO PRODUCTION TIPS:**

### **Option A: Simple Phone Recording (5 minutes to make)**
```
1. Use your phone camera (vertical or horizontal - both work)
2. Props needed:
   - Your locked Metro phone
   - Parents' locked AT&T phones
   - Printed flyer (mock sweepstakes)
3. Stand in good lighting (near window)
4. Record in one take (authentic > perfect)
5. Upload to YouTube (unlisted or public)
6. Send link via text
```

### **Option B: Simple Slideshow (10 minutes to make)**
```
1. Use Canva (free) or PowerPoint
2. Create 8-10 slides with simple graphics
3. Record voiceover using phone
4. Combine using free tool (Canva Video, iMovie, etc.)
5. Upload to YouTube
6. More polished but takes longer
```

### **Option C: Hybrid (Best of both - 15 minutes)**
```
1. Film yourself talking (intro + closing)
2. Screen record slides for middle section (showing numbers)
3. Combine using phone video editor
4. Upload
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Option A - Just film yourself talking!**
- More authentic
- Shows real phones
- Personal connection (you did landscaping for him)
- Can make it in 5 minutes

## 💬 **FOLLOW-UP TEXT (If No Response After 3-5 Days):**

```
Hey [Name]! 

No worries if you haven't had time to watch the video yet - 
I know how busy running a store is!

Just wanted to follow up quick: 

TL;DR version → We have contractors who need crew phones. 
We want to send them all to YOUR Cricket store for activation. 
Could mean 10-20 new customers/month for you at zero cost.

If that sounds interesting, I'd love to just grab 15 min of 
your time over coffee. I'll even bring my locked Metro phone 
and we can test the unlock process together.

Let me know! 🙌

- [Your Name]
```

## 🚀 **YOUR ACTION PLAN (THIS WEEKEND):**

### **Saturday Morning (1 hour total):**

**9:00am - Film Video**
- Grab your locked Metro phone
- Stand near window (good light)
- Film yourself talking through pitch (use script above)
- One take is fine! Authentic > perfect
- **Time: 15 minutes**

**9:15am - Upload to YouTube**
- Title: "Cricket Partnership Opportunity - Phone Donation Program"
- Description: "Nonprofit partnership proposal for Cricket Wireless stores"
- Set as "Unlisted" (only people with link can see)
- **Time: 10 minutes**

**9:25am - Create One-Pager**
- Copy the template above into Google Doc
- Add your contact info
- Save as PDF
- **Time: 5 minutes**

**9:30am - Send Text**
- Copy the initial text template
- Add YouTube link
- Add personal touch (reference specific landscaping job)
- Hit send!
- **Time: 5 minutes**

**Total time: 35 minutes** ⏱️

### **Then Wait:**
- Give him 3-5 days to respond
- Don't stress - he's busy running a store
- If no response, send gentle follow-up

---

## 💡 **BONUS: The "Soft Launch" Strategy:**

If he seems hesitant, offer this:

```
"Hey [Name], I totally understand if you want to see it in action first.

How about this: Let me send you just ONE contractor next week as a test.

If he activates service and you like working with him, then we can 
talk about making it a regular partnership.

If it doesn't work out, no harm done!

Sound fair?"
```

**This removes ALL risk** - he literally has nothing to lose by trying once!

---

## 🎯 **KEY TALKING POINTS (Memorize These):**

### **The Core Value Proposition:**
```
"We bring you guaranteed customers. You help us unlock phones. 
Everyone wins. Zero cost to you."
```

### **The Retention Lock:**
```
"Even on no-contract plans, these phones STAY with Cricket for 
6-12 months because they're network-locked. That's guaranteed 
recurring revenue you don't normally get!"
```

### **The Sweepstakes Hook:**
```
"For a $400 donation, you get $2,000+ in new activations. 
That's 5X return in one month!"
```

### **The Trust Factor:**
```
"I'm not asking you to take my word for it - I have my own 
locked phone right here. Let's test it together and see if 
this actually works before we do anything else."
```

### **The No-Pressure Close:**
```
"No contracts, no commitments. If you don't like it after 
the first month, we just shake hands and go our separate ways. 
But I think you're going to love the extra business."
```

---

## 📋 **OBJECTION HANDLERS:**

### **Objection: "I'm too busy to manage this"**
```
Response: "That's the beauty - you don't manage anything! 
We just send contractors to your store like normal customers. 
They activate service. That's it. Takes the same time as any 
other customer activation."
```

### **Objection: "What if the phones can't be unlocked?"**
```
Response: "Then we take them back and try another store. 
You're not stuck with anything. We only bring phones that 
are compatible with Cricket's network (AT&T/T-Mobile)."
```

### **Objection: "How do I know contractors will actually come?"**
```
Response: "Fair question! Let me send you ONE contractor next 
week as a test. No commitment. If he shows up and activates, 
great! If not, we tried. How's that sound?"
```

### **Objection: "I can't afford to donate a phone for sweepstakes"**
```
Response: "Totally understand! The sweepstakes prize is 100% 
optional. You can still participate just by helping unlock phones 
and getting the guaranteed contractor customers. The donation 
is just a bonus marketing opportunity if you want it."
```

### **Objection: "What's in it for you?"**
```
Response: "Great question! I run a 501(c)(3) nonprofit helping 
construction workers. We get crew phones for contractors, help 
workers stay connected with families, and reduce phone theft in 
the community. Plus, I get to help a local business owner I 
already know and trust. Win-win!"
```

## 🎥 **ALTERNATIVE: 60-Second "Teaser" Video**

If 3 minutes feels too long, here's an ultra-short version:

```
[0:00-0:15]
"Hey [Name]! Quick question: Would you be interested in 
10-20 guaranteed new Cricket customers per month at zero cost?"

[0:15-0:30]
"Here's the idea: My nonprofit collects donated locked phones. 
We send contractors to YOUR store for activation. They need 
family plans for their crews."

[0:30-0:45]
"Best part? The phones stay locked to Cricket's network for 
6-12 months anyway, so you get guaranteed retention even on 
no-contract plans!"

[0:45-0:60]
"I made a longer video explaining everything, but if this 
sounds interesting, just text me back and let's grab coffee! 
No pressure - just an opportunity. Thanks [Name]!"

[Link to full 3-minute video in description]

## 🎯 **THE ULTIMATE PITCH (Your Breakthrough):**

```
"We have people donating old locked phones anonymously in exchange 
for sweepstakes entries.

You help us unlock them and activate service for our contractors.

We bring you 10-20+ new customers per month.

The phones stay locked to Cricket's network anyway, so they're 
guaranteed to renew for 6-12 months.

If you donate one phone as the sweepstakes prize, we send 50-100 
people to your store for donations and verification.

Everyone wins: Donors get prizes. Contractors get phones. 
You get customers. We help the community.

Zero cost. Zero risk. Just opportunity.

Want to test it with my locked Metro phone this week?"
