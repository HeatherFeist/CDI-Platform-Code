/*
  HINTS INTEGRATION EXAMPLES

  This file contains example snippets showing how to integrate the HintsContainer
  into various components (EstimatesView, TeamMembersView, BusinessLayout, ProfileSettings).

  These examples are intentionally kept as commented documentation to avoid
  duplicate exports/imports in the codebase. To use an example, copy the snippet
  into the target component file and import `HintsContainer` from the shared
  component path.

  Example usage (EstimatesView):

  // import HintsContainer from './HintsContainer';

  // ... inside JSX ...
  // <HintsContainer position="top" maxHints={2} />

  Note: Ensure the target component imports `Outlet` from 'react-router-dom' if using it.
