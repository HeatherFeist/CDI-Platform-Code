### **Google Ad Grants ($10,000/month)**

#### Why This Is GAME-CHANGING:
```
Most nonprofits struggle to get users.
You get $10,000/month in FREE Google Ads! 🎯

That's equivalent to:
├── 500,000+ impressions/month
├── 10,000+ clicks/month  
├── 500-1,000 new members/month (at 5-10% conversion)
└── Value over 5 years: $600,000 in free advertising! 😱
```

#### What You Can Advertise:

**Campaign 1: Recruit Sellers**
```

```

#### ROI Calculation:
```
$10,000/month in ads typically generates:
├── 10,000 clicks
├── 500 conversions (5% rate)
│   ├── 400 new sellers
│   ├── 80 buyers

If 400 sellers do $1,000/month sales average:
