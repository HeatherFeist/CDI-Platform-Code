## Example Requests & Responses

### Request: "Remove the background"

**AI Response:**
```
I can see you have a product photo with a cluttered background. Here's how to handle this:

Current Assessment:
- Background has furniture, walls, and distractions
- Item is well-lit and in focus
- Good candidate for background removal

How to achieve this:
1. BASIC: Use the auto-enhance feature - it won't remove the background but will make the item stand out more
2. RECOMMENDED: Use a free tool like remove.bg or PhotoRoom app
   - Upload your image there
   - Background removes in seconds
   - Download with transparent or white background
   - Re-upload here

Alternative:
- Retake photo on a plain white sheet or poster board
- Much easier than digital editing!
```

### Request: "Make this brighter"

**AI Response:**
```
Your image is currently underexposed. Here's the plan:

Current State:
- Overall brightness: 35% (quite dark)
- Shadows obscuring details
- Colors appear muted

Solution:
Click the "Auto-Enhance Photo" button below! It will automatically:
- Increase brightness by ~40%
- Boost contrast for clarity
- Enhance color vibrance
- Sharpen details

This will dramatically improve your photo for listings!
```

### Request: "Should I retake this photo?"

**AI Response:**
```
Let me assess your current photo:

Strengths:
- Item is in frame and centered
- Focus is acceptable

Issues:
- Very blurry/out of focus
- Poor lighting
- Background is messy

My Recommendation: YES, retake the photo

Here's how to get a better shot:
1. Use natural daylight near a window
2. Place item on white surface
3. Hold camera steady (use a surface/tripod if possible)
4. Ensure item fills 70-80% of frame
5. Take multiple shots and pick the sharpest

You'll see a HUGE difference in buyer interest with a clearer photo!

## Example Conversation

```
You: "How can I make this product photo look more professional?"

AI: "Great question! Here's what I see and how to improve:

Current Assessment:
- Decent lighting, but slightly yellow tint
- Background has clutter (books, wall decorations)
- Item is centered but takes up only 50% of frame
- Focus is good

To Make it Professional:
1. Background: Retake on plain white surface OR use remove.bg
2. Framing: Get closer - item should fill 75% of frame
3. Color: Click Auto-Enhance to fix yellow tint
4. Lighting: Current lighting is OK, but natural window light would be better

Quick Wins:
- Use my Auto-Enhance button for instant improvement
- Crop tighter (remove.bg does this automatically)
- Consider retaking on white background

You're close! These changes will increase buyer confidence by 40%."

AI: "Perfect! Here's how to remove the background:

EASIEST METHOD:

4. Download with white background
5. Upload to your listing
