- **Minimum Bid**: Set at the Funding Goal amount (e.g., $2,000).

**Assumptions**:
- Average Funding Goal (Seed Capital): $2,500
- Average Winning Bid: $5,000 (Conservative 2x multiple due to demand)
- Auction frequency increases over time

**Year-by-Year Projections**:

|------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------|

## 💡 Strategic Implications

1.  **Lower Risk**: The community validates ideas with their wallets. If a concept doesn't get funded, it doesn't get built.
2.  **Higher Engagement**: Donors become "invested" in the success of the business.
3.  **Scalability**: Capital is no longer the bottleneck; execution is.
