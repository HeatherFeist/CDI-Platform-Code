## 📊 Three Donation Layers (All Optional)

### **Layer 1: Seller's "Sales Tax Replacement" Donation** (0-7.5%)
**WHO PAYS:** Buyer  
**WHO GETS RECEIPT:** Seller  
**HOW IT WORKS:**
- Board volunteer sellers are **tax-exempt** (already paid tax when they bought products)
- Seller can optionally add 0-7.5% charge (mimics sales tax amount)
- Buyer pays this amount
- **Seller gets tax-deductible receipt** for this amount
- Seller essentially "passes through" the tax benefit to themselves

**Example:**
```
$100 item
+ $7.50 seller donation (7.5%)
= $107.50 subtotal

Seller gets:
- $100 item payment
- $7.50 tax receipt (deductible)
- Tax savings: ~$1.50-2.50
- Net benefit: $1.50-2.50 per $100 sale
```

### **Layer 2: Buyer's Platform Tip/Donation** (variable %, default 15%)
**WHO PAYS:** Buyer  
**WHO GETS RECEIPT:** Buyer  
**HOW IT WORKS:**
- Buyer can add optional tip/donation to platform (like DoorDash)
- Default 15%, fully customizable or decline
- **Buyer gets tax-deductible receipt**
- Goes to platform to support operations

**Example:**
```
$107.50 subtotal (item + seller donation)
+ $16.13 buyer donation (15% of $107.50)
= $123.63 grand total

Buyer gets:
- $16.13 tax receipt (deductible)
- Tax savings: ~$3-5
- Effective donation cost: ~$11-13
```

### **Layer 3: Zero Sales Tax** (because nonprofit)
**WHO BENEFITS:** Everyone  
**HOW IT WORKS:**
- As 501(c)(3) nonprofit, transactions may be sales tax exempt
- Board volunteer sellers definitely tax-exempt (already paid tax)
- Buyers save 7.5% sales tax vs traditional marketplace
- This savings makes the donations feel like "free money"

## 🎓 Board Volunteer Benefits

### Who Qualifies as Tax-Exempt Seller:
✅ Member of board role group (not THE board member)  
✅ Volunteer roles: Technology, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Community, etc.  
✅ Contributing time/expertise to nonprofit mission  

### Why They're Tax-Exempt:
- They already paid sales tax when purchasing products
- As board volunteers for 501(c)(3), their resales are tax-exempt
- Can pass through tax benefit via optional 0-7.5% "donation charge"
- Creates incentive to join board volunteer groups

---

## ⚖️ Legal Compliance

### Why This Works:

**1. Everything is Optional**
- ✅ Seller donation: Optional (0-7.5%)
- ✅ Buyer donation: Optional (customizable or decline)
- ✅ Nothing is mandatory

**2. Proper Tax Status**

**3. Proper Documentation**
