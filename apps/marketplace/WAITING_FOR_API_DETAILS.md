## 📋 What I Need:

When you find the details, please share:
1. **API endpoint URL** (what URL does it call?)
2. **API key format** (does it start with `AIza...` or something else?)
3. **Package/library name** (what npm package are you using?)
4. **Code snippet** (if possible, the API call code)

## 🎯 Once I Know:

I can quickly integrate it into your auction platform so you can:
- Upload product photos
- Use natural language: "Show this t-shirt on a female model"
- Generate professional product images
- Add to listings

**Take your time finding the details!** Once I know what API you're using, I can integrate it. 🚀

Meanwhile, your current Gemini setup should work for:
- ✅ Image analysis
- ✅ Photo coaching
- ✅ Description generation

Would you like to test those features while you look for the image generation API details?
