### For the Platform

## Legal Considerations

### IRS Compliance (501(c)(3))
✅ **Voluntary Donation** - Not mandatory, not tied to goods/services
✅ **Quid Pro Quo** - Membership benefits are separate from donation
✅ **Substantiation** - Proper receipts issued for all donations >$250
✅ **Disclosure** - Clear communication that donation is separate from membership

### Tax Deductibility
✅ **Business Expense** - Platform costs are ordinary and necessary
✅ **Charitable Contribution** - To qualified 501(c)(3) organization
✅ **Documentation** - Instant receipts with EIN and donation amount
✅ **No Benefit Received** - Donation is separate from item sale

### Key Distinction
- **Membership dues** → Access to benefits (workspace email, tools)
- **Voluntary donation** → Separate transaction support donation
- **Not required** → Can be member without ever making donation (0% setting)
